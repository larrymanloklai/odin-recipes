    <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
    <p>The best homemade fried rice you can make! The bacon may be nontraditional, but it adds a little extra crunch. This is great with chicken or beef.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups water</li>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>¼ pound bacon, cut into strips</li>
        <li>⅛ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen green peas, thawed</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, season eggs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in small frying pan. Pour in eggs. Coat the bottom of the pan evenly with eggs; cook for about 3 minutes. Flip eggs, cook 1 minute more, and transfer them to a coli surface. Let coli, then cut into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spoon remaining 2 teaspoons oil into the skillet with the bacon fat. Stir in cooked rice; break up any clumps and toss to coat with oil. Stir in bacon, soy sauce, peas, eggs, and green onions. Stir and cook until heated through, approximately 3 minutes.</li>
