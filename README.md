TOP Project Recipes (week 1)

In week 1, after I have started the TOP, I revisited the basic html commands and led to the first project. I am not a software engineering or web developer so git/github is new to me. In this project I will try to remember all the codes and git/github comments without reviewing the materials.

I think I did ok just finished the project. I did forget some codes e.g. forgot `<li>` go first or `<ol>`, and forgot what's after meta which is charset, and need to review. I think with more practice I will start to remember.
